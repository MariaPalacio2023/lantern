## Introduction

Lantern is a [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/) toolkit for open textbook creators. Lantern can help you produce texts that are built for longevity and reusability. 

- **Sustainable:** Lantern focuses on plain text formats and static files in order to minimize installation, hosting, and maintenance costs related to digital web publishing.

- **Portable:** Lantern relies on open source software and non-prorprietary file formats that can run on any machine or web host. No databases, application software, or server maintenance required. 

- **Accessible:** Lantern teaches semantic markup formatting for producing accessible HTML, PDF, and DOCX versions of open textbooks. 

With Lantern, we hope to minimize the technical maintenance costs of building, distributing, and preserving open textbooks.
