#### Exercise Title

From the critical resolved shear stress for single crystal aluminum shown in Table 1, calculate the minimum force (in pounds) that must be applied to a one half inch diameter rod of single crystal Al to deform plastically.

<summary>Solution</summary>

The critical resolved shear stress for pure, single crystal Al is 148 psi, so we need to figure out what tensile stress on the sample will produce this value for the resolved shear stress, $\tau_{rss}$. The smallest value of $\sigma$ for which $\tau_{rss}$ is equal to the critical value of 148 occurs for the slip system with $\varphi = \lambda = 45^{â—‹}$, so from Eq. [5.1](#eq:resolved_shear_stress) we get $\sigma = 2\tau_{rss} = 296$. Multiplying by the cross sectional area of the rod gives:

$$F{= \left( {296 psi} \right) \cdot \pi \cdot \left( {0.25 in} \right)^{2} = 58 pounds}$$

This is a pretty small force, and is much less than the force required to deform a stock piece of aluminum that I would find in the machine shop.
