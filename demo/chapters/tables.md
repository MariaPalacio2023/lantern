# Example Chapter

This is the introductory paragraph. Paragraphs in markdown don't require any special tags or syntax. They just need to be separated by one or more lines. 

This is another paragraph element in markdown. 

And another! You should **not** use tabs or spaces to denote indentation. Markdown formatting is all about the structure and semantics of documents. We can use layouts, templates, and stylsheets to control display preferences. 

## Section Heading

This is a blockquote from "Dante and the Lobster" by Samuel Beckett:

> “My God” he whined “it's alive, what'll we do?” The aunt simply had to laugh. She bustled off to the pantry to fetch her smart apron, leaving him goggling down at the lobster, and came back with it on and her sleeves rolled up, all business.

## Helpful VS Code Extensions

Here are some recommended extensions for VS code to help make formatting textbook content easier:

### Markdown+Math

Some textbooks might include math equations, formula, theorems that need special formatting. The long-standing method for mathematical formatting is the LaTeX typesetting system that includes specific commands. For example, here is the definition of Christoffel Symbols:

$$
(\nabla_X Y)^k = X^i (\nabla_i Y)^k = X^i \left( \frac{\partial Y^k}{\partial x^i} + \Gamma_{im}^k Y^m \right)
$$

Everything between the `$$` is LaTeX code. The [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) extension will render that code as math in your preview panel. Visit [the website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) for more information about its use.
